## IPvGreen

### Overview
IPvGreen is a Chrome extension that provides insight into the sustainability of websites that rely on Amazon's AWS.

It is based on the [IPvFoo extension](https://github.com/pmarks-net/ipvfoo).

### Installation

#### Note

Until the [version in the Chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipvgreen/japapgcichafkoenponokhilebeejbch) is granted the necessary permissions, this extension needs to be installed as a developer extension.

#### Install
To install the extension, follow [this guide](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-install-chrome-extensions-manually/) on installing Chrome extensions via the developer menu.
You can skip step 3 and either use the zip in /release or clone this repo and point Chrome's extensions to /src.
